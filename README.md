# Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict housing prices in the state of California. The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle platform and contains various features of houses in different regions of California.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be obtained from Kaggle. It is available at the following link: [Laptop Price Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## Model Development

The development stages of the project include the following steps:

- Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The dataset is explored, missing values are handled, and features' distributions and relationships are visualized.
- Feature Engineering: Transformations are applied to existing features or new features are created.
- Model Selection and Training: Models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor are selected, trained, and evaluated.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is measured and compared.

## Requirements

You'll need the following libraries to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
